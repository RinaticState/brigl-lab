# brigl-lab
Why: Dr Brigl's website that's currently hosted on the BWH server needs a facelift from the generic Wordpress Template. I wanted apply what I learned from Dr Angela Wu's web development course. This has been my first real, serious project !
Made with the Bootstrap Framework, my own HTML and CSS.
Also, access to all the papers :)
