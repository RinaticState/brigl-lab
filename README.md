[Dr Brigl's website](https://brigl.bwh.harvard.edu/) that's currently hosted on the BWH server needs a facelift from the generic Wordpress Template. 

I wanted apply what I learned from Dr Angela Wu's web development course. This has been my first real, serious web dev project that's mainly front-end focused. I am excited to do be able to do more using JS in the future.

Also, access to all the papers :)
