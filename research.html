    <p class="p-research p-cd1">
      In addition to MHC-restricted recognition of peptide antigens, the immune system has evolved the capability to
      recognize lipid antigens presented by CD1 molecules <sup><a href="pdfs/porcelli1999.pdf">1</a>, <a href="pdfs/brigl2004.pdf">2</a></sup>. Humans and mice express
      CD1d (group 2 CD1); in addition, humans express the group 1 CD1 molecules CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c. Numerous studies
      have identified diverse infections and a range of non-infectious diseases such as autoimmunity, allergy, and tumor
      immunity, in
      which CD1-restricted T cells play critical roles <sup><a href="pdfs/brigl2004.pdf">1</a>, <a href="pdfs/tupin2007.pdf">2</a>, <a href="pdfs/cohen2009.pdf">3</a></sup>. Our studies are focused on better
      understanding the roles and functions of CD1-restricted T cells during infection and
      inflammatory diseases. Harnessing CD1-restricted, lipid-reactive T cells provides intriguing opportunities for the
      development of novel treatment and vaccine strategies.

      Two distinct subsets of CD1d-restricted NKT cells exist in mice and humans, based on their utilization of distinct
      TCRα and β genes: <strong>invariant (iNKT, or type I)</strong> and <strong>diverse (dNKT, or type II)</strong> NKT
      cells <sup><a href="pdfs/bendelac1997.pdf">1</a>, <a href="pdfs/godfrey2004.pdf">2</a>, <a href="pdfs/brennan2013.pdf">3</a></sup>.

    <img class="img-fluid img-research img-invariants" src="images/research-3.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="p-research">
      iNKT cells express an invariant Vα14-Jα18 TCR α-chain, recognize the prototypical α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer)
      antigen, and display an activated/memory phenotype in the absence of prior stimulation <sup><a href="pdfs/bendelac1997.pdf">1</a>, <a href="pdfs/kronenberg2005.pdf">2</a>, <a href="pdfs/brennan2013.pdf">3</a></sup>. Following activation, iNKT
      cells rapidly produce large amounts of cytokines,
      followed by cross-activation of other immune cells. Through their interaction with other immune cells, iNKT cells
      can modulate the
      evolving innate and adaptive immune responses, but iNKT cells themselves do not generate memory responses. Thus,
      iNKT cells behave like innate, rather than adaptive lymphocytes. In response to infection or inflammation, iNKT
      cells can be
      stimulated either by recognition of microbial lipid antigens, or by an indirect mechanism. The indirect mechanism
      requires recognition of self-lipid antigens and co-stimulation by inflammatory cytokines secreted by antigen
      presenting cells in
      response to microbial products or other inflammatory stimuli <sup><a href="pdfs/tupin2007.pdf">1</a>, <a href="pdfs/brigl2010.pdf">2</a></sup>. The
      indirect mechanism of iNKT cell activation is operational in vivo during a wide range of bacterial and fungal
      infections <sup><a href="pdfs/brigl2003.pdf">1</a>, <a href="pdfs/nagarajan2007.pdf">2</a>, <a href="pdfs/mattner2005.pdf">3</a>, <a href="pdfs/cohen2011.pdf">4</a>, <a href="pdfs/brigl2011.pdf">5</a></sup>, and likely also
      during non-infectious conditions. Regulation of the expression of potent stimulatory self-lipid antigens plays a
      critical role in
      this pathway of iNKT cell activation <sup><a href="pdfs/paget2007.pdf">1</a>, <a href="pdfs/salio2007.pdf">2</a>, <a href="pdfs/brennan2011.pdf">3</a></sup>. Our focus is
      to better understanding how the regulation of self-lipid antigen presentation by CD1d as well as soluble mediators and
      cell-surface ligand/receptor interactions modulate the diverse functions of iNKT cells in protection from and
      exacerbation of infections and non-infectious inflammatory diseases.

    <img class="img-fluid img-research img-dnkt" src="images/research-4.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="p-research p-dnkt">
      In addition to the widely studied Vα14+ iNKT cells, CD1d-restricted NKT cells using diverse TCRα and β genes have
      been described and are commonly referred to as type II or dNKT cells <sup><a href="pdfs/godfrey2004.pdf">1</a>, <a href="pdfs/rhost2012.pdf">2</a>, <a href="pdfs/brennan2013.pdf">3</a></sup>. A number of recent studies have provided important
      insights into the biology of dNKT cells by
      demonstrating critical immunomodulatory functions of dNKT cells during infections and non-infectious inflammatory
      conditions; however, progress in understanding the function of dNKT cells has been significantly impeded by the lack of specific
      markers to identify dNKT cells and by the limited knowledge of the lipid antigens they recognize. dNKT cells have
      been identified as a significant population of CD4+ T cells remaining in MHC II-deficient mice, in wild-type mice, and in humans, based
      on their reactivity to CD1d-expressing APCs <sup><a href="pdfs/cardell1995.pdf">1</a>, <a href="pdfs/behar1999.pdf">2</a>, <a href="pdfs/chang2008.pdf">3</a></sup>.
      Although dNKT cells use diverse TCRα and β genes, preferential use of certain TCR genes has been reported <sup><a href="pdfs/park2001.pdf">1</a>, <a href="pdfs/arrenberg2010.pdf">2</a></sup>. dNKT cells differ from iNKT cells in other respects. For example,
      transgenic expression of the TCR of an auto-reactive dNKT hybridoma led to the development of dNKT cells that expressed chemokine receptors and integrins
      distinct from iNKT cells. dNKT cells do not recognize α-GalCer, and their mode of recognizing sulfatide/CD1d
      complexes is different from iNKT recognition of lipid/CD1d complexes, and appears more similar to peptide/MHC recognition <sup><a href="pdfs/patel2012.pdf">1</a>, <a href="pdfs/girardi2012.pdf">2</a></sup>. Thus, dNKT cells have antigen specificities and functional
      characteristics distinct from those of iNKT cells. We have recently identified microbial and mammalian phospholipid antigens that are recognized
      by dNKT cells <sup><a href="pdfs/tatituri2013.pdf">1</a></sup>. Our research is focused on better understanding the antigen specificities
      and functions of dNKT cells, and to delineate their roles during infection and other non-infectious inflammatory diseases.
